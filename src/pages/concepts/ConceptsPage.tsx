          Hooks (functions starting with "use") have strict usage rules. Here's where you <strong>cannot</strong> call them:
        </p>

        <div>
          {[
            'Do not call Hooks inside conditions or loops',

            'Do not call Hooks in class components',
            'Do not call Hooks inside functions passed to useMemo, useReducer, or useEffect',
            'Do not call Hooks inside try/catch/finally blocks'
          ].map((rule, index) => (
            <div

        </div>

        <div>
          <p>
            ‚úÖ <strong>Remember:</strong> Always call Hooks at the top level of your React functions, in the same order, every time.
